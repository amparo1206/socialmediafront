### `Tuitter`

Meet my version of Twitter called Tuitter.รง

This social network is made with REACT and its styles with SASS.

It has been a great learning, now let's see each part of it.

## Register

Here is the register.
All fields are compulsory, if you don't fill in one of them you will get a warning, it also has a double password verification.

We have used the ant design library to pop up a notification if the action has been completed successfully, or on the contrary something has failed.

Also when you register you receive a verification email, so you can start using our wonderful Tuitter.
